#Refheap

A simple plugin that helps you share public snippets
of code via [Refheap](http://www.refheap.com).

You can post a selected part of a file or the whole
file if there's nothing selected, by using the
`Refheap: post to Refheap` command.

The plugin will try to detect the language you are using
by looking at the edited file's extension.
